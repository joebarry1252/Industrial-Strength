## Industrial Strength

In this project, our group members each selected three stocks from the industrial sector to analyze (total of nine stocks analyzed). Using machine learning, we each trained our models to predict future prices of these stocks and compared our models' accuracy. The stocks picked for our project were:

Machinery/Conglomerates: CAT, DE, and HON
Aerospace & Defense: BA, LMT, and RTX
Motors/Generators: CMI, EMR, GNRC
