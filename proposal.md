# Project Proposal

## Project Title: Supreme Broccoli

## Team Members: Ahsan, Dennis, Joseph

## Project Idea:

Stock Price Predictor: 
Predicting future stock prices for industrial stocks

## Outline/description

The three of us are each analyzing a different sub-sector of the Industrial stocks. Using historical data to train, we will create a machine learning model to predict these stock prices, compare the predicted to what the actual prices were, and finally use the model to project what future prices may be.

## Research questions to answer
Which of the following stocks' future prices can be projected best using our ml model:
(CAT, DE, HON)
(CMI, EMR, GNRC)
(BA, LMT, RTX)


## Datasets to be used


## Rough breakdown of tasks

(CAT, DE, HON) - Joseph
(CMI, EMR, GNRC) - Ahsan
(BA, LMT, RTX) - Dennis
